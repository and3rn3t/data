# Levels 3-6 Polishing Complete

## Overview

Successfully completed polishing and quality assurance for all challenges in Levels 3-6 of the Data Science Sandbox platform. All deprecated API calls have been updated and challenges now run flawlessly with modern library versions.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Level 5 - Challenge 1: Advanced Algorithms

**Issue:** Deprecated sklearn parameter in BaggingClassifier

- **Problem:** `BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=...)` parameter was deprecated
- **Solution:** Updated to use `estimator=` parameter instead
- **File:** `challenges/level_5/challenge_1_advanced_algorithms.py`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED and TESTED

### Level 6 - Challenge 1: Time Series Analysis

**Issue:** Incorrect matplotlib API calls

- **Problem:** Using `plt.set_title()` which doesn't exist in matplotlib API
- **Solution:** Changed to correct `plt.title()` method
- **Additional Fix:** Updated `plt.set_ylabel()` to `plt.ylabel()` and `plt.set_xticks()` to `plt.xticks()`
- **File:** `challenges/level_6/challenge_1_time_series_analysis.py`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED and TESTED

## Testing Results
