### **Enhanced Maintainability**

- Separated concerns (apps, examples, runners, docs)
- Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries
- Easier to locate and update components

### **Professional Structure**

- Industry-standard project layout
- Clean root directory with only essential files
- Well-organized documentation hierarchy

### **Better Developer Experience**

- Quick navigation with directory-specific READMEs
- Clear usage instructions and examples
- Logical file organization

## 📂 Current Root Directory (Clean)

The root directory now contains only essential project files:

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Update Import Statements** - Update any hardcoded paths in code to reflect new locations
2. **Update CI/CD Pipelines** - Adjust build scripts for new file locations
3. **Update VS Code Tasks** - Modify task definitions for moved files
4. **Documentation Review** - Validate all links and references are updated
5. **Team Communication** - Share organization changes with development team

## 📝 Maintenance

- Regular documentation updates as features evolve
- Consistent naming conventions for new files
- Maintain README files as directories grow
- Periodic organization reviews to ensure structure remains optimal

This organization provides a solid foundation for the project's continued growth and development.
