### 5. CI/CD Pipeline

Created `.github/workflows/ui-tests.yml`:

- Matrix testing across Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox)
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Performance auditing with Lighthouse
- Automated test reports uploaded to GitHub Pages

### 6. Documentation

- `docs/UI_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `tests/ui/README.md` - Quick start guide
- Inline documentation in all test files

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Test Environment Management

```python
# Automatically starts Streamlit test server
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def streamlit_server() -> Generator[StreamlitTestServer, None, None]:
    server = StreamlitTestServer(str(app_path))
    server.start()  # Starts on port 8502
    yield server
    server.stop()   # Cleanup
```

### 2. Smart Element Detection

```python
# Utilities for robust element interaction
await StreamlitTestUtils.wait_for_streamlit_ready(page)
await StreamlitTestUtils.click_sidebar_button(page, "Challenges")
await StreamlitTestUtils.get_metric_value(page, "Experience")
```

### 3. Visual Debugging

- Automatic screenshot capture on test failures
- Screenshot generation at key test points
- Screenshots stored in `tests/ui/screenshots/`

### 4. Flexible Test Execution

```bash
# Multiple ways to run tests
python tests/ui/test_runner.py --smoke     # Quick validation
python tests/ui/test_runner.py --full      # Complete suite
python tests/ui/test_runner.py --report    # With HTML report
pytest tests/ui/ -m ui -v                  # Direct pytest
```

### 5. Cross-Platform Support

- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- PowerShell and Bash script compatibility
- Docker-ready for CI/CD environments
