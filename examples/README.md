# Examples

This directory contains demonstration scripts and example implementations:

## Demo Files

- `demo_enhanced_gamification.py` - Demonstrates the gamification features and user experience
- `demo_modern_toolchain.py` - Shows modern data science toolchain integration
- `demo_production.py` - Production-ready deployment example

## Usage

Each demo can be run independently to showcase different aspects of the platform:

```bash
# Run gamification demo
python -m examples.demo_enhanced_gamification

# Run modern toolchain demo
python -m examples.demo_modern_toolchain

# Run production demo
python -m examples.demo_production
```

These examples serve as both demonstrations and reference implementations for learning how to use the platform effectively.
