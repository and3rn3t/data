# 🎮 Data Science Sandbox - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your comprehensive data science learning platform! This guide will get you up and running in minutes.

## 🚀 One-Command Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/and3rn3t/data.git
cd data

# Run the automated setup (this will take a few minutes)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Test your installation
python main.py --help
```

## 🎯 Your Learning Journey

### Phase 1: Getting Started (30 minutes)
```bash
# Start with the CLI interface
python main.py --mode cli

# Or launch the web dashboard
python main.py --mode dashboard

# Try your first challenge
cd challenges/level_1/
# Copy the code from challenge_1_first_steps.md and run it!
```

### Phase 2: Development Setup (15 minutes)
```bash
# Open in VSCode with full integration
code data-science-sandbox.code-workspace

# The workspace includes:
# ✅ Python debugging configurations
# ✅ Automated testing setup  
# ✅ Code formatting and linting
